# 🧠 BRAIN GLITCH ASSISTANT

## ⚙️ Built on Output-Driven Architecture (ODA)

Brain Glitch is an AI Insight Engine that goes beyond chatting — it's designed to clarify what you're doing, where you're going, and how to get there.

Unlike generic assistants, Brain Glitch uses **Output-Driven Architecture (ODA)** to deliver laser-focused, context-aware insights that help you move from *intention* to *outcome*.

## ✨ What Is Output-Driven Architecture?

Output-Driven Architecture (ODA) is a design philosophy where the *desired outcome* drives every interaction.

> It’s not about what you’re doing.  
> It’s about what you’re achieving.

Brain Glitch uses 4 structured insight formats:

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t | 🔄 Cause & Effect | 📌 Clarity (Refactor) |
|------|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Positive recommended action | Avoid this mistake | Why this matters or what it leads to | Reframe goal or refocus approach |
